# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating an advanced Electron desktop application that creates sentient virtual companions capable of multimodal perception, dynamic personality generation, and proactive interaction. The application will evolve through three phases: establishing a multimodal data processing pipeline, creating a dynamic personality engine, and implementing proactive companion capabilities with continuous learning.

## Requirements
